/// from the run interval, so that the total cycle time stays as close to
/// interval as possible.
///
/// If an iteration takes longer than the interval, the next iteration
/// starts immediately (sleep time saturates to zero).
///
/// Example usage looks like:
///
/// ```ignore
/// let timer = PeriodicTimer::new(Duration::from_secs(30));
/// loop {
///     let tick = timer.tick();
///     ..do your work here.
///     tick.sleep().await;
