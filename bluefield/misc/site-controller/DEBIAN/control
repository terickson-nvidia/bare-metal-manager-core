Description: OpenTelemetry for site controller DPUs
 This package installs the OpenTelemetry collector and mTLS renewal agent.
 It expects an OS-provided JSON file at /etc/site-dpu.json containing an
 array of "endpoints" in the form { "fqdn": "some.fqdn", "ip": "10.0.0.1" }
 as well as "site" and "domain" values. During installation, a post-install
 script reads this file and updates /etc/hosts and sets hostname.
